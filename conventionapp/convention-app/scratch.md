Planning on making separate models for regular registration, quran registration and bazaar registration

TODO
- Implement search bar for day of attendees so able to query by string
- For quran search, may be worth trying to use v-data-table and brainstorm how to edit, best way may be to have edit popup for all data except checkedIn
- For quran search, filters for each level
