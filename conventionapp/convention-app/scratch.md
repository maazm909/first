Planning on making separate models for regular registration, quran registration and bazaar registration

TODO
- Add update button to attendee row
- Change how attendee search handles row change, use update button click event
- For quran search, may be worth trying to use v-data-table and brainstorm how to edit, best way may be to have edit popup for all data except checkedIn
- For quran search, filters for each level
